# External_interrupts
Use of external interrupt in Atmega328p microcontroller

## Introduction
The program toggles an LED on the falling edge of a button press. The button acts as the external interrupt. The program was written as part of a learning series; use of
external interrupts in AVR microcontrollers.

## Technologies
